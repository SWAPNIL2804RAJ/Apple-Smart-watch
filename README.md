# Apple-Smart-watch #UI/UX #Figma
The Apple smartwatch is a wearable device that allows users to access a variety of features and apps from their wrist. The UI design of the smartwatch is essential for providing a user-friendly and intuitive experience.I have designed an animated UI design for apple smart watch. 
So this is my 2nd project in Figma UI/UX design. In this i took a frame of Apple watch of 44mm with width 184 and height 224.Then I made 11 frames of the same 

So, here what it looks like:
![1](https://github.com/SWAPNIL2804RAJ/Apple-Smart-watch/assets/124730254/3305b74b-3d84-40a4-8ba9-c99f708a60f0)

You can see there are 12 frames and a heading and Instructions how to operate it.
So let's go to each frame one by one
1st Frame: 
![2](https://github.com/SWAPNIL2804RAJ/Apple-Smart-watch/assets/124730254/15d06ea4-5e15-44c4-b098-6e5b61b2c193)
This contains the home page of Apple smart watch where there is written a good morning notification with date and time also other features that are present in real smart watch is also shown such battery, weather and a voice assistant Siri is also represented. To move to second page "CLICK" on the first page.
Now, 2nd Frame:
![3](https://github.com/SWAPNIL2804RAJ/Apple-Smart-watch/assets/124730254/070f8447-5005-43d8-a450-dccd771b8cb3)
So, this contains the 2nd page of Apple smart watch in which the main menu is represented. The main menu screenshot has been taken from the google. To move to the 3rd page you have to "Remove the mouse cursor from the watch".
Now, 3rd Frame:
![4](https://github.com/SWAPNIL2804RAJ/Apple-Smart-watch/assets/124730254/ce81acca-265f-44c4-9360-389fdb8299fd)
So on removing the cursor from the watch in the previous frame, you will be redirected to the 3rd frame which contain activity homepage. Now "CLICK" on the watch to go on the 4th frame.
Now, 4th Frame:
![5](https://github.com/SWAPNIL2804RAJ/Apple-Smart-watch/assets/124730254/8f1b5a10-1b77-44a6-8d63-d79a7ffb7611)
So, here is the 4th frame which contains the activity design. It looks like simple made up of 3 different color circles but it contains 6 cicles of different colours and different design. Now, for next frame you dont have to click on do anything, it will automatically get animated after some delay.Here, prototyping is used.
So, the 5th Frame :
![6](https://github.com/SWAPNIL2804RAJ/Apple-Smart-watch/assets/124730254/8bec6948-d1b3-4c26-864f-8c0000176979)
Now go to the next page, "CLICK"on the the watch.
6th Frame: 
![7](https://github.com/SWAPNIL2804RAJ/Apple-Smart-watch/assets/124730254/395ef27c-65df-487d-b775-aef658ac9a86)
So, the 6th frame consist of the fitness track as shown in the real apple smart watch. Here you can look at your steps, heartrate and calories burnt. Moving to the next the next page will be automatically viewed after some delay. Here the animations are being added.
7th Frame:
![8](https://github.com/SWAPNIL2804RAJ/Apple-Smart-watch/assets/124730254/1666d3e7-c120-4023-a122-38bca196824b)
8th Frame:
![9](https://github.com/SWAPNIL2804RAJ/Apple-Smart-watch/assets/124730254/87bb6d71-1c73-4c87-9d7b-3000965822a0)
So, the 8th frame consist of the music player, where the music is being played in the background and on the watch track-lines are being shown. From here next 3 frames are being animated and will be played after some delay of time. And to go back to the home page remove the mouse cursor from the watch once the track stop moving, you will be redirected to the homepage. And if you want to go to the activity page then click on the activity which is present on the top of the watch.
So, the next consectutive frames are 9th, 10th and 11th frame :

Now at last I would like to share the prototype overview in form of the Image:
