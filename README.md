# Apple-Smart-watch #UI/UX #Figma
The Apple smartwatch is a wearable device that allows users to access a variety of features and apps from their wrist. The UI design of the smartwatch is essential for providing a user-friendly and intuitive experience.I have designed an animated UI design for apple smart watch. 
So this is my 2nd project in Figma UI/UX design. In this i took a frame of Apple watch of 44mm with width 184 and height 224.Then I made 11 frames of the same 

So, here what it looks like:

You can see there are 12 frames and a heading and Instructions how to operate it.
So let's go to each frame one by one
1st Frame: 
![2](https://github.com/SWAPNIL2804RAJ/Apple-Smart-watch/assets/124730254/15d06ea4-5e15-44c4-b098-6e5b61b2c193)
This contains the home page of Apple smart watch where there is written a good morning notification with date and time also other features that are present in real smart watch is also shown such battery, weather and a voice assistant Siri is also represented. To move to second page "CLICK" on the first page.
Now, 2nd Frame:
![3](https://github.com/SWAPNIL2804RAJ/Apple-Smart-watch/assets/124730254/070f8447-5005-43d8-a450-dccd771b8cb3)
So, this contains the 2nd page of Apple smart watch in which the main menu is represented. The main menu screenshot has been taken from the google. To move to the 3rd page you have to "Remove the mouse cursor from the watch".
Now, 3rd Frame:
![4](https://github.com/SWAPNIL2804RAJ/Apple-Smart-watch/assets/124730254/ce81acca-265f-44c4-9360-389fdb8299fd)
So on removing the cursor from the watch in the previous frame, you will be redirected to the 3rd frame which contain activity homepage.
